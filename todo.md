# todo list

## before live deployment
- check auth when saving build (`/builds/[slug]/+server.ts`)
- search/sort/filter builds
- vote system
- show own builds
- name builds

## before 1.0
- search/filter active skills
- only selecting the first weapon closes modal
- missing images
    - engineer runes
    - thrust versatility skills (legionaire)
- cut bounding box on runes cause they overlap
- delete builds
- sending all 100s of images at once on every request seems bad, maybe request once and cache in browser?

## ideas
- add to favourites system (different from the vote system, makes it easy for users to find their favourite builds)
- assign each tag a different colour for visual information without even reading the text
