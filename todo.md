# todo list

## before live deployment
- search/sort/filter builds
- show own builds

## before 1.0
- use view to query data (drizzle studio seems to crash with views)
- search/filter active skills
- only selecting the first weapon closes modal (but only sometimes :/)
- missing images
    - engineer runes
    - thrust versatility skills (legionaire)
- cut bounding box on runes cause they overlap
- sending all 100s of images at once on every request seems bad, maybe request once and cache in browser?
